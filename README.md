A simple non-graphic sudoku solver that automatically solves a 3 x 3 Sudoku grid. I embedded a main function with a 2 dimensional array to represent the sudoku grid which can be tweaked in any way you want with your own numbers to get a solution of the grid. NB: Separate the outputted numbers into 3x3 boxes to perfectly map out the solved grid.
